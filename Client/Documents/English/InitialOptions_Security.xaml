    <Paragraph>
        Eudora.Net encrypts its local data. Your email account details, email,
        and even non-critical data such as your signatures and stationery are all encrypted.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
        In order to achieve this, at this step you will create an encryption key. Although this
        key is effectively your password, it's more useful than that. Your key will be stored
        in the Windows Credential Manager -- the operating system's secure storage for such things.

        <LineBreak/>
        2. Your key will roam with your Microsoft account, meaning that if you use Eudora.Net
        on multiple PCs, your key will travel with you to whichever machine you're logged into.
