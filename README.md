# Eudora.Net
## A brand new email client inspired by the once-dominant Qualcomm Eudora^1

Eudora.Net is built from scratch with the goal of providing the look and feel of classic Eudora in an email client that is new and modern inside.

Fans of the original will find that the bulk of the UX is exactly where they expect to find it, with only minimal changes.  

Notes:
1. Qualcomm is in no way responsible for this software. Please don't contact that company with feedback about Eudora.Net, lest they hurl rocks upon us.
